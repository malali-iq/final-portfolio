        <p>
          The portfolio I prepared demonstrates substantial growth and an
          overall overview of the work I've been doing this semester. The
          initial part of the information is applicable to all racial groupings
          in the United States. The first project #2 is entirely focused on
          race, specifically white supremacy. The second project #4 is about
          gender in our society and its significance, as well as gender's impact
          on our daily life. The last project #3 is on class in the US and the
          substantial impact of class and economic variables that take place
          within this country. All of these projects have been reworked. The
          original and revised drafts of these can be found at the following
          URLs. During the revision process, the measures taken were
          straightforward. I had written and submitted papers that had been
          graded and on which I had received comments during the semester. I
          used the helpful input I received to improve these works. I used a lot
          of the feedback I got to strengthen my paper on these important
          topics, which I worked really hard on. For some of the primary themes
          that were presented, I employed a lot of critical thinking as well as
          thinking outside the box. I was able to successfully construct and
          enhance my papers to include in this final portfolio as a result of
          this critical criticism.
